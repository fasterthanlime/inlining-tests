..according to the Beatles.

To run this repo, here's what you actually need:

  * <http://github.com/nddrylliog/rock>, the 'generic-inlining' branch. very latest. no, yesterday is not latest.
  * <http://github.com/josthecoder/proof>

If the tests look too trivial for you, you should probably use your magic -onlygen wand and look at the C output.
You'll shit bricks.

ndd - hey look, it's 3AM - rylliog.
